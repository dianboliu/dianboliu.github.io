## The Three A's

### Automatic AI Evolution Engine

**AI for AI that improves AI.**

We develop machine learning models that autonomously plan and conduct interactions with environments and data to learn from experience. Our research focuses on:

- Post-training Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Memory systems for agentic AI
- Learning from experience rather than relying solely on human data
- Self-improving AI architectures

### Automatic AI Creativity Engine

**Enhancing creativity in generative AI.**

We work to enhance the creativity of generative machine learning models, enabling them to propose truly novel content. Our focus areas include:

- Post-training techniques for LLMs
- Fundamental mechanisms of diffusion models
- Novel content generation
- Creative problem-solving in AI systems

### Automatic AI Discovery Engine for Biomedical Sciences

**AI-driven scientific discovery.**

We leverage self-evolving AI with improved creativity to accelerate discoveries in biomedical sciences. This includes:

- AI for drug discovery
- Genomics and epigenomics analysis
- Medical image analysis
- Clinical decision support systems
