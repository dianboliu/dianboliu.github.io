## About our lab

Our team develops fundamental machine learning methods that enable AI systems to autonomously conduct scientific research.

We are based at the **National University of Singapore** and led by **Dr. Dianbo Liu**.

Our team was previously called "CogAI4Sci" Team

## Research Focus: The Three A's

Our research is organized around three core themes:

### Automatic AI Evolution Engine
AI for AI that improves AI. We develop machine learning models that autonomously plan and conduct interactions with environments and data to learn from experience. Our focus includes post-training LLMs and memories of agentic systems for learning from experience rather than relying solely on human data.

### Automatic AI Creativity Engine
We work to enhance the creativity of generative machine learning models, enabling them to propose novel content. Our focus areas include post-training LLMs and fundamental mechanisms of diffusion models.

### Automatic AI Discovery Engine for Biomedical Sciences
We use self-evolving AI with improved creativity to help make new discoveries in biomedical sciences.

## About the PI

# Leo Dianbo Liu (刘钿渤)

**Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore**

*"Push the limits of humankind for the greatest benefit to all"*

Before starting the Artificial Scientific Intelligence Lab, Dianbo Liu was a group leader at the **Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard**. Prior to the Broad Institute, Dianbo worked as a postdoctoral researcher with **Prof. Yoshua Bengio** (a Turing Award winner) and led the Humanitarian AI team at the **Mila-Quebec AI Institute**.

This followed his fellowship training and studies in medical informatics at **Harvard Medical School**. Dianbo earned his PhD from the **University of Dundee, Scotland**, under the supervision of particle physicist Prof. Timothea Newman.

During his doctoral studies, he received the **Vest Principal Scholarship** from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was a special graduate student at the **MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab**.

Dianbo also co-founded two start-ups, **GeneTank** and **SecureAILabs**, to advance AI applications in sciences during his training.

## What We Believe

> "Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
> — Steve Jobs

> "The future depends on some graduate student who is deeply suspicious of everything I have said."
> — Geoffrey Hinton
